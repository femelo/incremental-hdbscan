# Incremental HDBSCAN (I-HDBSCAN)

This is the repository of the Python implementation of the I-HDBSCAN, a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm that can perform clustering progressively over time, taking data in batches. The algorithm also allows for clustering within a "window time", removing data points older than a given time threshold.
